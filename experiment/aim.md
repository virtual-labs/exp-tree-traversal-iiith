### Learning Objectives of the Experiment

In this experiment, we will be able to do the following:

   - Demonstrate understanding of the concepts of inserting elements into the heap, extract max operation and the rebuild operation in heapsort as key operations in heap sort
   - Given an unsorted array of numbers, generate a sorted array of numbers by applying heapsort
   - Understand HeapSort operations and associated time complexity through interactive animations
   - Demonstrate knowledge of time complexity of heapsort by counting the number of operations involved in inserting heap and removing the root till the array becomes sorted (heapify operation)
