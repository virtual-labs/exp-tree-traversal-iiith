### Learning Objectives of the Experiment

In this experiment, you will be able to do the following:

  -  Iterative and recursive traversals on Binary Tree, their algorithms, time and space complexity analysis.
  -  Difference between search and traversal in a binary tree.
  -  Understand the two broad categories of traversals, Breadth First and Depth First Traversal.
  -  Given an inorder and preorder/postorder traversal , re-construct a binary tree.
  -  Applications of different traversals in computer programming and compilers.
