### What is Tree Traversal?

Traversing a tree means visiting each node in a specified order. Linear data structures such as arrays, linked lists have only one logical way to traverse them, as each nodes has a single entry and exit point. Since each node in tree, does not have unique entry and exit points, trees can be traversed in different ways.
### Types

There are mainly two types of tree traversals
1. Depth First Traversal
2. Breadth First Traversal
### Definition

**1. Depth First Traversal**: Depth First Traversal, as the name suggests, is a traversal technique, in which we traverse the tree in a depth first manner. This means that we start from the root node and keep going down the “depth” of the tree until we reach a leaf node (a node having no children) and then traverse back again to the node we started with.

**2. Breadth First Traversal**: Breadth First Traversal, also called as level order traversal of the tree, is a traversal technique, in which we traverse the tree in a "breadth first" manner. This means that nodes are traversed level-by-level in the tree from left to right.

### Search vs Traversal
**Traversal**: Traversal of a tree involves examining every node in the tree.<br>
**Search**: Search in a graph is an accelerated look-up, which involves visiting nodes in the graph in a systematic manner, and may or may not result into a visit to all nodes.
